## Self-Introduction
Hi, my name is Ali Feinblatt and I am a Sophomore at Lehigh University! I am majoring in Health, Medicine, & Society and Journalism. I am originally from New York City, and I have lived there my whole life. When I am older, I want to move back there. I have two older sisters. Carly is seven years older than me, and Rachel is five years older than me. Carly went to Syracuse and Rachel went to Wisconsin. Part of the reason I am interested in Journalism is because of Rachel. She majored in Journalism at NYU, and now writes for a magazine. I am very impressed with her work and it inspires me to want to major in Journalism.
