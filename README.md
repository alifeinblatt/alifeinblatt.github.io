## Self-Introduction
Hi, my name is Ali Feinblatt and I am a Sophomore at Lehigh University! I am majoring in Health, Medicine, & Society and Journalism. I am originally from New York City, and I have lived there my whole life. When I am older, I want to move back there. I have two older sisters. Carly is seven years older than me, and Rachel is five years older than me. Part of the reason I am interested in Journalism is because of Rachel. She majored in Journalism at NYU, and now writes for a magazine now. I am very impressed with her work and it inspires me to want to major in Journalism. I am also extremely interested in Health, and I am not sure what I want to do after college, whether it is health, journalism, or a mix of both!

## Coffee Price vs. Total Cups in Various Countries 
Here is a chart showing the coffee price in various countries, and the number of cups of coffee that those countries drink in millions. As you can see, there is not much of a correlation between the price and the number of cups of coffee. It is crazy to compare the most expensive country to the least expensive, when they are both selling coffee!
